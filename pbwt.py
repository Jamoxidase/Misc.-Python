'''
Python implimentation of PBWT (Positional Burrows-Wheeler Transform) algorithm based
on on Durbin et al. paper. (doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu014). This script contains 
functions to construct the reverse prefix sort matrix, construct Y from X, construct 
X from Y, construct common suffix matrix, and efficiently get long matches from a 
set of binary strings from transformed representation.


Given M sequences with N bi-allelic variable sites, an O(NM) algorithm to derive a representation
of the data based on positional prefix arrays is given, which is termed the positional 
Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform (PBWT). On large datasets this compresses with run-length encoding by 
more than a factor of a hundred smaller than using gzip on the raw data. Using this representation 
a method is given to find all maximal haplotype matches within the set in O(NM) time rather than 
O(NM2) as expected from naive pairwise comparison, and also a fast algorithm, empirically 
independent of M given sufficient memory for indexes, to find maximal matches between a new 
sequence and the set.

# Construct Reverse Prefix Sort Matrix
def constructReversePrefixSortMatrix(X):
    """
    Computes the reverse prefix sort matrix A for a given set of binary strings X. For 
    integer 0<=i<=N we define an ith prefix sort as a lexicographic sort (here 0 precedes 1)
    of the set of ith prefixes: { x[:i] | x in X }. Similarly an ith reverse prefix sort 
    is a lexicographic sort of the set of ith prefixes after each prefix is reversed.

    Parameters:
    - X: A list of binary strings.

    Returns:
    - A: An Mx(N+1) Numpy integer array, where M is the number of strings in X
         and N is the length of each string.
